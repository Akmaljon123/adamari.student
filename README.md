About the Project

I chose to create web a site for "Adamari Store" as it was one of the most fastest growing clothes shop in the Uzbekistan. They are mainly focused on the clothes not on additional accessories like perfume and etc. So, because of this reason I decided to start this project which allows customers to shop online without leaving their home. Another purpose of this project is to encourage people to do shopping online, which provides less action and is way more convenient than going to clothes market. In this website, people can order clothes online and after 1- or 2-days dedicated employees will deliver their purchases. In the future, I want to make the delivery process live on the website so that customers do not need to call to the company for getting an update on their purchase. 

In order to deploy this project into production, I used GitHub pages as it was the most user-friendly and editable. Here is the link for my website: https://akmaljon123.github.io/adamari.student/
